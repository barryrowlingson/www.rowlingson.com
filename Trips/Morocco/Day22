We're quite pleased to get out of such a bustling campsite, and decide
on an easy drive north past Meknes to Volubilis, to see the roman
ruins. We get a bit lost in Meknes, when the signposting system of
Morocco lets us down again. We forget to look behind us for signposts.
<p>
The roman ruins appear on the hillside from a distance. We follow the
signs and pull into the campsite, and pay our few dirham to get
in. This is the best preserved roman site in Morocco, and there are
several mosaics left in situ.

There's also a large amount of standing ruins, including a triumphal
arch that as probably been reconstructed. A long row of columns marks
where the forum once stood.

There's a small cafe, and so we get some ice cream and cola and sit
and eat in the sun. Then its time to head off again.
<p>
Eventually the campsite appears, and its a nice one. Shady, with a
terrace for sitting and reading, a swimming pool (but a bit grimy),
and a shop selling cold drinks. We sit on the terrace and read as the
sun goes down and it starts to get cold.
