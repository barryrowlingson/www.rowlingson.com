We wake up to a full blue sky and the true beauty of our campsite can
be appreciated.

<p>
Every bush has its resident beetle. Some have two or three. These are
the Darkling Beetles of the Atlas, and they are living up to their
reputation as ferocious little creatures. Sam spots one carrying off a
Scarab Beetle - not a shy retiring insect in itself. Carol sees two of
them cutting open her plastic garbage bag to get at the juicy morsels
within. They are all over the place. We pack up and leave, and as
usual, Sam rolls Elsa forward so I can pop out and make sure we've
left nothing underneath. All we've left is the splattered remains of
one unlucky beetle, looking much like a rather large fried egg. Sorry.
<p>
We carry on along this high desert plain. There are mountains all
around, and we have fun trying to guess where the road is going to go
next. At some point it has to start going down, and we should enter
the Todra Gorge. We are also aware that if we get it wrong then we
could end up in the wrong gorge, and come out miles away from where we
want to be. 
<p>
But the top of the gorge is unmistakable, with jagged rock peaks
standing guard as the track drops off the high plain and begins its descent.

Elsa poses for photographs at the top, looking like the
expedition-ready cat that she is.

<p>

The rock scenery in this part of the gorge is amazing, with
yellow-brown walls and overhangs and cracks. Sam and I can't resist
getting out and having a scramble.

<p>

By now we're getting some traffic coming up. As well as the usual big
four-wheel drive Bedford trucks, driven by Berbers and overloaded with
everything, there's now small cars trying to make it up the
gorge. We're almost in day-tripper country.
<p>

<p>
We know we're reaching the end of the gorge because now we see people
walking up. For a laugh, Sam and I say our hellos in a multitude of
accents. The replies are in a multitude of languages. 
<p>
We turn a corner and we're in the most photographed part of the Todra
Gorge. This is the bit you see in all the guide books. And its spoilt
by being full of cars, and music, and picnicking people, with rubbish
everywhere and people hassling us for one reason or another. Some want
to sell us things, one wants to buy the Land Rover.
<p>
Getting photographs of the scenery here is difficult. You need
something to hide the crowds in the gorge and show off the
scenery. Sam positions himself behind Elsa and gets this shot:

<p>
You can see me in the background of that picture taking this
shot. There's some small rocks that I realise can obscure the mess if
I get low enough:

<p>
Then I get Abbie and Carol and Mike to stand close together to shield
the camera from the rabble:

<p>
Here we feel we are back in civilisation again. There's a hotel, a
cafe, cars, people. There's several four-wheel drive vehicles that are
obviously tourist transport, including a very large truck of some
description kitted out with full desert gear and a coupled, powered
trailer that interests Sam somewhat.
<p>
Eventually we hit the road for Ouarzazate. Now we're back on tarmac
again. We stop for Mike to pick up some petrol, and some kids hassle
us in Elsa. We teach them some rude english words for their troubles.
<p>
We're now driving in open desert dotted with palm tree groves along a
fairly dry river,with high mountains all around. We stop for another
rest and again a small child appears. He's not as annoying as the
previous bunch, so we give him some of our empty bottles to recycle
and collect a few dirhams deposit, and I show him some juggling. He
waves as we drive off, clutching his prize bottles.
<p>
We arrive in Ouarzazate and find a campsite near the centre of
town. Sitting in the corner is a red Land Rover 110 Defender with UK
plates and full desert gear. We introduce ourselves, and meet Louis,
who is travelling to Australia with four of his friends. Two of them
are currently sorting out their personal differences in Marakesh,
while Louis, Daniella, and Giles relax in the desert sunshine. Their
vehicle is well kitted out for a long haul, and Sam admires the
gear. They have a water filter complete with shower. Round the back
they have a neat tent set-up, together with a laptop computer with DVD
player. We're invited round to watch a movie later. They even have
comfortable folding chairs.
<p>
We eat and drink and then Sam talks Land Rovers with Louis for
hours. He's dead jealous, and wants to tag along with him to
Australia. Sadly he knows he has to come back. Its nearly the half way
point in the trip and Sam will soon have to start thinking about
heading back.
