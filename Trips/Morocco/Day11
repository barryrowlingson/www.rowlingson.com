<!-- text here, from after the H1 to the end nav bits -->

Its an early start for us at 8am. The transport is loaded and ready to
go by 9am. We head out in convoy behind Mike and Carol in their Nissan
Crew Cab. They clearly have the edge on us for speed on the main
roads. 
<p>
We're heading through forest now. Mike pulls over ahead and parks
behind another vehicle. We pull up. There's monkeys in the trees!

<p>
Further on we see a large white hawk - possibly an eagle - flying
majestically in the hazy sky. 
<p>
We reach the tiny village of Rich and top up with fuel. From here we
leave the tarmac behind, and now Elsa is leading. We're heading for
the High Atlas mountains.

<p>
There are no signposts as we hit a tiny village. Children come out
shouting and asking for presents. "Donnez-moi un stylo!" and "Bonbon!"
become familiar cries. They don't tell us where to go so Sam follows
his nose. We're on another rough track out of the village.
<p>
We enter a narrow gorge, with high bare rock climbing above us and
green agriculture in the bottom, where water still flows.

<p>
 Stone and
mud villages cling to the sides, and as we pass through them life stops
as they wave and shout at us. I don't think many white Land Rovers are
seen in these parts.

After a good few miles of being in this canyon the view opens out
to a landscape of small scrub and distant hills. We have 
followed the river upstream and are now approaching the top of its
catchment. It's now getting dark and so we look for a good place to
camp. We pull off the main track and stop on a flat spot above the
river, which is fairly dry here. A local on a horse walks past in the
distance. We are away from all the city lights. 
<p>
As we start brewing up for tea and coffee, and cooking up our food for
the evening, we notice we are not along. Our presence has been noticed
by alien eyes. Large, black beetles have appeared from under the rocks
and out of the bushes. Showing no fear they approach our lights and
fires. I'm glad its my turn to sleep in Elsa!
