We don't want to have another bad night in northern Spain like we did
on the way down, so we start early and get going. Suddenly Spain is
behind us and we are through the border. Then there's a panic as we
hit a French toll booth. Its been three weeks since we needed French
money. We dig some francs out of the bottom of our bags and pay, and
then roar off in a cloud of black smoke. Elsa's oil seals need a bit
of work, but Sam enjoys leaving a trail of thick oily fog behind him
at the tollbooths.

The only other thing that happens this day is that the clutch pedal
gets a bit floppy. We put the bonnet up and find the clutch master
cylinder filler. The bonnet has to come off to give us room to get
some leverage on the lid. Luckily Land Rovers are designed for easy
disassembly. With the lid off, we can see the problem. No fluid. That
also explains the dribbles under the clutch pedal. We pour some more
in, and hope we can get away without having to bleed the system.
<p>
As it gets dark we find another petrol station/truck stop place and
pull in. This one seems to be full of Moroccans, possibly heading back
after having August in Europe. There's trucks and camper vans. And
toilet paper everywhere. Its not very hygienic. We eat more cold beans
and sleep in the back of Elsa.
