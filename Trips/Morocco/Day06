<!-- Day 6 - Gibraltar and Back -->
<!-- text here, from after the H1 to the end nav bits -->

The music never stops. Its still throbbing at 7am when I decide I've
had enough and I'm going to complain in the strongest possible
terms. Well not really. I wander along the beach as the sun
desperately tries to get up from its sleepless night. There are four
young people outside the bar, still moving to the techno rhythms.
<p>
At 9am the music stops. None of us got much sleep. Abbie's ear problem
is getting worse, so it is decided to get her to a doctor. Sam
suggests we head for Gibraltar so we can find an English-speaking
doctor. We were going that way anyway. Also, Sam wants to get his flat
tyre fixed to we have two spares for the rest of the journey.
<p>
There are no road signs to Gib - something we assume is due to the
Spanish embarrassment for having a little bit of the Empire on their
doorstep - but we know the way. West. Still no
roadsigns. Then we round a corner and there it
is. Unmistakable. Clouds form in the wind shadow of this imposing rock.

<p>
Now there are signs for Gib, but they aren't needed.  There's a thin strip
of Spain that connects Gib to the rest of the world, and at the end of
that is the frontier. We go straight through and across the
runway. Instantly the two and half thousand km between us and England
are gone. We are in a world of proper traffic lines, familiar
policemen, legible roadsigns and of course, awful parking. After
driving round most of the lower part of the island with Sam pointing
out miscellaneous bits of military hardware, we pull into a parking place
and I kiss the ground as we get out of Elsa.
<p>
Sam and Abbie head off to find a doctor and explore, and I sit inside
and listen to the World Service on the radio. They return, and I hear
how different doctor's hours are in Gibraltar. The clinic opens at
5pm. Perhaps this is after they've finished with all the rich
clients. Perhaps its because it is Sunday. That explains why the
garage is also shut, so Sam can't get Elsa's flat tyre fixed.
Anyway, that means we have an afternoon to spend here. So we
decide that we're not going to make Africa today and play tourist for
the day.
<p>
The tourist signs point us up the hill and we park Elsa up a lane half
way up the rock. There are paths all over the rock, dotted with old
military ruins.

<p>
Sam points out all the ships in the harbour. There's also a British
nuclear submarine, which is in Gib for repairs but the spanish aren't
too happy about it.
<p>
The tracks climb the side of the rock, and from the crest you can look
over the side and see the dizzying drop over to the Med beyond.

<p>
We head for the cafe and gift shop and sit and eat ice creams while
watching the battleships through our binoculars. As we drive down the
steep tracks back into the town we pass the famous Gibraltar monkeys,
fattened by tourist offerings.
<p>
We find the Gibraltar Safeway. Its the biggest shop we've seen for six
days. We get lots of tins of food to keep us going through the next
three weeks, since we dont know what food provisions will be like in
Morocco. We also get enough mineral water to fill several jerry cans,
and spend ten minutes in the car park emptying plastic bottles into
our jerries.
<p>
Its now pat five and the clinic should be open. I head off with Abbie
while Sam sits in Elsa and ponders our purchases. The clinic seems to
be full of children and mothers. After waiting about half an hour
Abbie is in and out in two minutes. She has a prescription for some
antibiotics, so we head off to find a pharmacist in the back alleys of
the town. 
<p>
Its now dinner time, and so we find a pub. Having a meal cooked for
us, with no need to think about washing up is quite a refreshing
change. There's too much for me and Abbie to finish, so Sam tucks in
and almost licks our plates clean.
<p>
So where to camp for tonight? We hope that last night's rave was a
Saturday night thing and the devout Spanish wouldn't permit such a
thing on a Sunday night. So we head out of Gibraltar and back to the
beach. There are fewer people on the beach now, and there's no techno
music banging out of the bar. At 11pm a small family arrive in a
camper van and unpack their house - including children, dogs and pet
birds. They start cooking their dinner and make noises for another
couple of hours. We decide to sleep in the tent to keep the sand out
of our sleeping bags.
<p>
Maybe tomorrow we'll get over to Africa, but there's a few things we
need to sort out first.
