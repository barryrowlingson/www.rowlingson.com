We rise at 8.30. There's a couple with a small child camping near
us. They have obviously been here sometime, since they have
constructed something like a garden around their tent. The man is
trying to get to work in his camper van but he's stuck in the soft
sand. We get to use the winch and tow him out, with many thanks.
<p>
As we drive on the sand, we bounce and one of the sand ladders slips
out of its mount on the roof. I jump up to help stick it back on, and
something goes in my back. Agony. Half way up my back something has
taken a dislike to lifting something and is now screaming for me to
stop. The others spot my obvious distress instantly. Even breathing is
painful. I've had this sort of thing before, but this was pretty
bad. I knew it would go soon, so I ask for some rest and then we can
get on with it.
<p>
So its back to Algeciras and this time we do want to get on the
boat. There's no great queues, no bureaucratic problems, just lots of
Moroccans with luxury goods strapped to the tops of their
cars. Washing machines must be in short supply over there.
<p>
On the boat we get our passports stamped and Sam joins the bundle to
get the necessary paperwork for Elsa sorted out. Some people will tell
you this is a complex business, but it all goes smoothly. 
<p>
Sam and Abbie pose for pictures on the boat.

So we arrive in Africa. We drive off and pass straight through
customs. Again, people will tell you horror stories of Moroccan
customs, but we don't have such an experience. But now we have to
find a campsite.
<p>
I'm using the Lonely Planet and Rough Guide maps of Tangier to find
our way to a campsite that isn't on the map. Its direction is
indicated on the map - but no mention of distance. I plot a straight
route through town to it.
<p>
So we climb up a steep street and we're slap bang in the middle of a
market square. A busy market square. With people and traders and
bicycles and donkeys and barrows. We're suddenly in the sights and
smells of Morocco. People are shouting at us. I have my window down
and the first person I speak to in Morocco offers us dope. I
nonchalantly wave him off and frantically try and find the way out. We
head off down a side street. Then we get onto a larger road, but its
not much. I don't know where we are, but I think we're going in the
right direction. I'm following my nose. We pass a whole street of
metalworkers, putting together gates and welding parts of cars. Sparks
fly and we wave as we pass.
<p>
I've still got no idea where the campsite is, but I point Sam to a
tiny lane and we squeeze down it. A signpost. Camping. We found
it. Allah is looking over us.
<p>
Down a windy drive we find the campsite office. It's a shady spot with
a sea view and the noise of the water below us. We park up and pitch
the tent. It feels safe to be in a campsite.
<p>
We wander into the new part of Tangier to do some business and find
another cybercafe. Its a bit less well-equipped than the one in
Gibraltar, but we its enough to send some more emails. I have trouble
finding the right keys on the arabic keyboards.
<p>
While walking back to the campsite Sam and I get mistaken for
Australians. Guess it must be the wide-brimmed hats. Good job we dont
have corks hanging from them.
<p>
Back at the campsite we eat and bed down for a quiet night.
