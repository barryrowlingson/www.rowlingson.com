<h1>The Djemaa El Fna</h1>
<img src="djemaa1.jpg"><p>
This is the Djemaa El Fna, the square in Marakesh where all the action
is. We tried to stay in a hotel here, but it was fully booked up. We
drove off into the new part of the town and eventually found a hotel
with a suite for the three of us.
<p>
We returned to the Djemaa El Fna the next night, to take in the
atmosphere and watch the locals and tourists from a cafe bar terrace
overlooking the spectacle.
