We wake and pack to leave Zagora. Everything is ready for our trip
across the southern desert.
<p>
The guide book shows us a picture of the famous sign to Timbuctoo at
the end of town. Sam wants to find it. I get him to pose in his desert
gear for it:

<p>
The sign has obviously been repainted since the guide book photograph
- not only are the camels different but the arrow is pointing in the
opposite direction!
<p>
We turn left, away from 'Timbouctou', and head through a small village
and then the tarmac turns to dust. We're now on tracks in the desert.
Soon we have the feeling of being in splendid isolation.

<p>

At a small hill with a well I take a wrong turning and we're on soft
sand. Mike gets stuck. We jump out and my feet hit the burning
sand. The sand ladders on the roof have been roasting in the desert
sun for hours and are almost red hot, but they still have to come down.

<p>

We start digging, and soon several of the locals who were standing by
the well turn up to help digging. Mike is quickly out and we're on
solid ground again. The locals expect some reward. Mike hands out some
cash and they also ask for cigarettes. None of us smoke, so Mike
offers them Polo mints. I don't know what they make of them. Or of us.
<p>
Mike is now feeling sick. He has had trouble keeping down any liquid
and it seems his temperature is rising. Despite the air conditioning
in the Nissan he's not getting any better. Sam discusses putting a
drip line in him to rehydrate him. Mike says he's been like this
before in the heat, and he's not dead yet. Sam and I discuss emergency
plans, such as one of us driving back to civilisation.
<p>
But as the sun starts to sink and the temperature drops, we are less
concerned, and Mike seem to improve. He's now sipping from a drinks
bottle slowly, and we've given him some of our rehydration solution.
It seems a good time and place to camp, so we pull up alongside the
piste and put the tent up, to give us some shelter from wind-blown
dust in the night. Sam and I wander off into the sand to talk, and
spot animal tracks. Lizards are clear from their footprints and tail
marks, but we also spot larger prints that could be foxes or desert rats.

<p>
Hazy low cloud has built up, and we have no spectacular desert sunset. 
Sam jumps in the back of Elsa, and I get into my sleeping bag in the
tent alongside Abbie. The night is warm - but not humid - and I soon have
to unzip my bag and sleep under it. I am tired, and hoping for a good
nights sleep before we press on the next day. Passing traffic is
probably not a problem, but I expect we might hear one or two cars
or trucks pass in the night.
<p>
At about midnight, I hear a low rumbling in the distance. It sounds
like a vehicle. Its faint, but getting louder. I must have been
sleeping lightly. My expectation is that it will get louder, and
then in a roar and a glare of headlights, will pass us by. But it 
takes its time.
<p>
I look out through the mesh of the tent and can see nothing back
along the track. Then I notice that the tail lights of our Land
Rover are on, and Sam is outside. The noise in the distance stops. I get
out of the tent and walk over to Sam.
<p>
Its quiet. Sam signals for silence. I can hear nothing. The sky
has cleared partly, and a near-full moon is lighting up the desert
landscape from a low angle. Sam hops back into the front and
switches the lights off.
<p>

"What's up?", I ask. "I don't know.", he says. He had heard the
noise of the vehicle in the distance and got up to see what was going
on. From the top of the Landy, using binoculars, he could just about
make out a vehicle in the distance. He had put the lights on so that
they could see we were here. And that was when they stopped.
<p>
We discuss theories. Gun runners taking weapons to Algeria. When
they saw our tail lights they thought we were police, or army. So
they'd stopped.
<p>
I grab my binoculars and scan the far hills of the barren
landscape. Nothing. Sam directs me. Left of that hill. Right of that
bush. We can hear faint voices, becoming louder, and more agitated.
Then suddenly there's a series of silent bright flashes, lighting up
the sand, and then, delayed by the distance, the sound of automatic
gunfire hits us.
<p>
A number of thoughts go through my head in an instant. Wake Abbie,
wake Mike and Carol, get everyone in the Land Rover and get out of
there. Leave the tent, leave the Nissan, run like hell. But things
unfold all too quickly in my binoculars.
<p>
Almost immediately two headlights shine out and we hear the engine being
stretched to its limit. The vehicle starts off towards the south, and
we watch it quickly disappear behind a hill. The sound becomes a low
rumble, and it fades off into the far south, towards the Algerian
border.
<p>
We decide to head back to the spot where the action had occurred, so
we jump into Elsa and head down the track, headlights on
full. It takes us about five minutes to find the spot. A man is lying across
the track. Sam slams on the brakes and we stop and kick up a
plume of dust into the headlights. We jump out, but its obvious
there's nothing we can do for this young arab. He's lying in a
pool of blood, and is very dead.
<p>
We listen again. Silence. Sam picks up a couple of empty rounds
from the desert, and identifies them as being from a Russian rifle of
some sort. For a moment we have no idea what to do next. We are a good
day's drive from the nearest village, and there might be no other
traffic through here for days or weeks. We can't take this man with
us, and we can't leave him out here in the desert. We had already
seen eagles and vultures, they would make short work of him. So we
decide we have to bury him here.
<p>
We take the spades from the Land Rover and dig into the soft sand. I
take my compass and made sure the hole points towards Mecca. We
wrap him in a blanket, and gently place him in the ground. I read
a few words from my English translation of The Koran. We fill in the
hole. I take a map reference from my GPS so we can tell the
authorities once we reached civilisation, although I doubt if they
would have much sympathy for a religious extremist gun-runner. But to
us, he was just another desert traveller.
