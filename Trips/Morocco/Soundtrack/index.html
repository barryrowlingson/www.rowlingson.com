I took a bunch of tapes to listen to on the long journey. I was
expecting the others to bring a few tapes themsleves, but only Abbie
managed to remember. Perhaps Sam doubted my ability to wire up a
stereo to Elsa's electrics. That meant we ended up playing the same
albums quite a few times. Abbie brought a couple of tapes - a mix of misc
pop tracks and some classical music that came in handy on <a href="../Day05/">Day 5</a> when we felt the need to assert our Britishness.
<p>
I filled up some tapes with a few miscellaneous tracks I had lying around.
I was surprised to find that neither Sam nor Abbie had heard 
<i>Marakesh Express</i> by Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young!
<p>
<ul>
<li>The Bloodhound Gang - <i>Hooray for Boobies</i>
<p>
Very rude, and very funny. "You must die, I alone am best!" became a
catchphrase between Sam and me. Abbie didn't join in. Perhaps a whole
album about porn stars, oral sex and drugs just didn't appeal to her?
<p>
<li>Ondar - <i>Back Tuva Future</i>
<p>
An album mixing western beats with Tuvan throat singing. This is a
vocal style from Mongolia that involves singing multiple notes by
using resonances in the mouth. Sam loved it. My efforts at throat-singing
kept Sam and Abbie entertained for about two minutes.
<p>
<li>Levellers - <i>mouth to mouth</i>
<p>
Who'd have thought that crustie music would travel so well. "What a
Beautiful Day" is a great start to a morning. Brought back memories of
seeing them at the V99 festival.
<p>
<li>Pink Floyd - <i>Wish You Were Here</i>
<p>
Perhaps the most atmospheric Floyd album, with the epic multi-part
"Shine On You Crazy Diamond". 
<p>
<li>Ozomatli - <i>Misc</i>
<p>
Crazy latin beats and raps from these boys. Check them out. I first
saw them on a Glastonbury festival TV programme, and they were clearly
enjoying themselves, stage diving and dancing all over. The next day I
got as much of their stuff as I could find.
<p>
<li>Aquabats - <i>Misc</i>
<p>
The Ska revival scene in the US spawned a lot of dull ska bands, but
these guys are so wacky they stand out. Check out <i>Lobster 
Bucket</i> or <i>Captain Hampton and the Midget Pirates</i>.
<p>
<li>Bonzo Dog Band - <i>The History of the Bonzos</i>
<p>
A `best of` album from the greatest comic band in the UK. You may only
have heard `Urban Spaceman' but there's more than that to them. 
<p>
<li>Robert Plant - <i>Now And Zen</i>
<p>
When we really needed something to keep Sam awake while driving long
hours we stuck this on and cranked it.
<p>
<li>Rush - <i>Moving Pictures</i>
<p>
Another album to keep Sam stimulated when caffeine supplies ran low. 
<p> 
<li>Santana - <i>Supernatural</i>
<p>
I took the best tracks from his new album and stuck them on a tape for
the trip. Pretentious latin guitar twiddlings? Yeah maybe, but the
best pretentious latin guitar twiddlings!
<p>
<li>Monkey Bucket - <i>Hot Air Baboon</i> and <i>Pants of Peace</i>
<p>
I knew the CD player in the machine was a bit iffy, but I brought along
a couple of CDs anyway. Mike and Carol had a listen to them in their
car CD player, but I dont think the desert environment was ideal for
our comic style. In return we borrowed some Billy Connolly, and had
the surreal experience of listening to obscene Scottish comedy whilst
in the 45 degree heat of the Sahara.
