<h1>Day 2 - Northern France to Southern France</h1>
<!-- Day 2 - Northern France to a Southern France Service Station -->
<!-- text here, from after the H1 to the end nav bits -->

We wake up to a sunrise over a small lake that we hadn't noticed the night before. Geese honk.

A few locals potter past in car and on bike and wonder what we're up
to. We wake up, and decide on a plan for the day.

We drive to a small town and get some breakfast - chocolate bread from
a patisserie. We also pick up some bread and cheese from the campest
cheeseshop assistant we've ever seen. We eat it sitting in the town
square on a quiet morning.
<p>
We carry on down the autoroute, past Paris where I get my first view
of the Eiffel Tower. However it is miles away and just a speck of a
needle on the horizon! The traffic round Paris isn't too bad.
<p>
French service stations are clean and neat. We stop at one for lunch,
and pause for photographs of the whole team.

The landscape has changed, and we're now obviously in southern
France. The trees are different. The air is warmer. By evening we're
looking for a camp spot, and find a quiet service station that is no
more than a toilet block and some parking spaces. We hang the army
ponchos off the Land Rover and Sam and I kip underneath. The sound of
insects chirping in the bushes keep us awake a while.
