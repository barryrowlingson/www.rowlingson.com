Okay, the stuff about guns and dead Moroccans yesterday was pure
fiction. We did hear something in the night, Sam and I looked for it,
and it drove off mysteriously in the direction of Algeria. Just a
little artistic license. Now back to the real story.
<p>
We get up after sunrise and Mike is feeling a lot better, so we
continue on the tracks.
<p>

<p>

Now we are travelling through very barren desert, with nothing but the
odd bush and occasional line of acacia trees. Lines of camels wander
across our path. We marvel at their economy of stride.
<p>

<p>
Then, to our left, is a wide flat spot. Sam decides this is the place
where he can get some action shots of Elsa in the Sahara, so I'm
instructed to take pictures while he bombs about in the sand. Mike
takes some videotape images too.

<p>
Then Sam stops and I look at him through my binoculars. He's picking
up bones from a camel skeleton and strapping them to the front of
Elsa. Seems a strange set of souvenirs but Sam explains he wants to
show them to the children he teaches back home. We carry on with
several parts of a camel stuck on Elsa.
<p>
Some point after this my GPS, which had worked perfectly, hangs
up. I'm looking at the display, and it is telling me its 2.5km to the
next waypoint. A minute later, its still 2.5km. I press some
buttons. Nothing. Even the off switch won't work. I pull out the power
lead, plug it back in, and its back online. This happens again, about
twenty minutes later.
<p>
Then it happens a third time. But when I reconnect it to the power
lead from the cigarette lighter socket it has done a hard reset. It
doesn't know where it is, and its lost all the route waypoints as well
as all the campsite waypoints I've made in the past two weeks.
<p>
Its no great job to re-initialise it and quickly enter 
grid references for the next few waypoints from the book. But its a
bit annoying. I don't know what caused it - possibly the heat,
although the spec for the unit claims it can cope with the temperature
we have in Elsa - so maybe its the power from the cigarette
lighter. It doesn't like Sam putting the main headlights on, since
this causes a power dip that makes the GPS think its been switched
off. We blame it on the CIA mucking about with the satellites.
<p>
Mike is still not happy with the heat of the day. We register over 40C
in Elsa. Getting stuck and having to dig the Nissan out doesn't help,
since when Mike exerts himself it makes his condition work. And he
doesn't like to stand around while Sam and I dig.

<p>
There's a small village across a dry lake bed. Someone in the village
is flashing lights at us - probably children playing with mirrors. We
decide to head for the village and make some decisions.
<p>
As we pull into the village we get the usual tail of small children.
There's a welcoming sign for a cafe, so we park the vehicles outside
and are ushered in.
<p>

<p>
It's a small mud building with a sign above the door. We get some
drinks and Mike and Carol have some omelettes. Inside the door is a
crude, hand-painted picture of Mickey Mouse, done straight onto the
plaster. Around the walls are postcards and pictures and stickers from
other travellers. There's a big Michelin map of the area on one wall.
<p>
Looking out the door, we see typical village scenery, with locals
sitting in the shade of the acacia bushes. It is perhaps the most
African view of the trip.
<p>

<p>
After some mint tea we get down to talking to the people here. There's
a couple of young men who run the cafe, and some small children
nervously looking in the door. They enjoy looking at Sam's books of
Africa, and Sam gives them some beermats - something probably never
seen in this part of the world.  I show one of the children how to
flip and catch them, and then they spend the next ten minutes fighting
over them to try and successfully flip them themselves. I expect
beermat flipping to be a major sport in Morocco in a few years.
<p>
The someone starts tapping their fingers and Mike joins in. Soon my
harmonica is out of my bag and I'm playing along. Hardly traditional
music but it was fun.
<p>
We decide on our route. The guidebook tells us how the tracks become
soft and sandy ahead, before Rissani, and after digging Mike out
enough times we decide it may be better to head north for the main
road. It's still quite a drive, but the locals assure us its a good
piste. After more mint tea we leave the cafe.
<p>
To the north of the village, there's another dry lake bed, walled in
by high mountains.
<p>

<p>
Eventually we see a gap in the mountains that the locals had told us
about, and head down it. Then we are on a desert plain, with small
villages and a multitude of tracks. Its hard to know which ones to
follow, so we soon end up on soft stuff. We have to dig Mike out
again, and Sam manages to get Elsa stuck for the first time!
<p>

<p>
Eventually we hit the road at the small town of Mecissi. I head into
the small shop and buy half a dozen bottles of Fanta and Cola. We
drink them eagerly. On the way to Erfoud the wind picks up and desert
sand starts to drift across the road, covering the edges. Before dark
we get to Erfoud, and find the campsite, which is quite a luxury, with
unsmelly toilets and a sizeable wash area. We spend the night in
comfort.
