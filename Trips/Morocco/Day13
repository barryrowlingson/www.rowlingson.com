We get up late after last nights Landython and get some shopping. The
plan is now to take on one of the desert pistes tomorrow, using
details in one of Sam's Saharan expedition books. We find the local
supermarket and pile in, buying plenty of tinned food to last us a
while. 
<p>
Back at the campsite a guided tour has rolled in. Four Land Rovers
with some logo on and full of eager desert explorers. They jump out
and immediately start banging tent pegs into the solid earth. In a
few minutes some very large old-style canvas tents have popped up.
<p>
We say our goodbyes to Louis and his crew, and swap emails, and then
hit the road to Zagora.
<p>
This is the Draa valley, following the Oued (river) Draa. Its stony
desert scenery, with dense forests of palm trees dotting bright green
amongst the sandy ground. From the trees hang clusters of dates,
drooping down low on their stalks.

We enter Zagora and find the campsite easy enough. It provides a lot
of shelter with high palm trees all around. There are other trees with
a variety of unusual fruit all around. There's a swimming pool that we
don't really like the look of. Two skinny tabby cats show a slight
interest in us. A dog is too scared to approach, even for some
food. Abbie spots a frog lurking in the undergrowth. It seems that the
trees have attracted all sorts of wildlife.
<p>
After dinner I enter the coordinates of the desert piste from
Tagounite to Rissani into my GPS. Sam's book has full details of the
piste, including coordinates, landmarks, and route descriptions. We're
all set for our trip out into the Sahara.
