We get up very late and decide to mooch around the campsite for the
day, doing chores. We collect sticks and twigs and bake some bread
over the fire. We drink more cola and sit and read on the terrace. Its
a pleasant sunny day.
<p>
There is an interesting arrival at the campsite. Sam identifies it as
a former East German decontamination wagon. Its basically a truck with
a big square tank on the back, and this one has been converted to a
camper. The occupants look none the worse for living in
something that could have been highly poisonous twenty years ago. 
<p>
In the evening we sit on the terrace and watch the sun go down.
