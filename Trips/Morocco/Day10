We arise and walk into town. Meknes has its Imperial Palace, bounded
by its long straight roads and high walls. Sam is reminded of scenes
from Star Wars.

We turn the end of one long street, and into another. Cars, taxis, and
Moroccans on bicycles stream by. Its now the midday heat. Palace
guards lounge in their sentry boxes with their guns swinging
casually. Sam says it wouldn't be like that in the British Army, oh
no.
<p>
We turn
another corner and there's a wool market, with raw fleeces hanging in
the shade with attendant flies and odours. Then its through some
classical arabic architecture of the Bab Mansour ('Bab' means gate)
and into the Medina.

<p>
The Medina is a maze of narrow streets and alleys, some covered, some
open to the skies, some inside big buildings divided up into narrow
corridors. There are clothes - both traditional and well-known western
brands - food, for the most part swarming in flies - material and
thread - musical instruments. We wander round, trying not to look like
tourists. Yeah sure.

We find our way out and wander back to the campsite. The shop is more
than willing to sell us large bottles of Coke and Fanta and we sit and
sip them outside the bar and read for most of the afternoon. 
<p>
Whilst on the hunt for firewood that evening we spot a Nissan
four-wheel drive with attached camper back, with UK plates. This is
Mike and Carol. They met in Marakesh thirty years ago, and have since
got married and raised children. They still come back to Morocco, but
this is the first time with a four-wheel drive. In the back they have
a small kitchen and a fridge. Sam thinks he's spotted fellow desert
travellers.
<p>
We decide that tomorrow we'll convoy through the High Atlas mountains
to the Todra Gorge. We share food and drink and pore over maps
deciding routes. We're getting ready for some serious off-roading at
last!
