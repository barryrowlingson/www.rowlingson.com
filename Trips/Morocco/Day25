We wake and pack Elsa ready to get back to Europe. The camp shop
supplies us with plenty of fizzy drinks for the journey to
Tangier. Just outside Meknes we stop to fill up six jerry cans full of
diesel. Its half the price of Spanish or French diesel, and nearly a
third the price of British diesel. Somehow Sam gets talking to the
attendant and the conversation turns to football - and once he
realises we are English he mentions 1966 and Bobby Charlton. I doubt
if he knows who David Beckham is.
<p>
Elsa takes us up the coast again and into Tangier. We drive through
the new town quarter and the signs lead us to the port with no
problem. As we enter the port, we are waved at by several
people. We're wary of accepting help from strangers but one of them
waggles an official pass at us and offers to help us do the
paperwork. Sam takes our passports and heads off to an office for
twenty minutes, then comes back and says we're all set. But first we
have to pay our helper, and we hand over pretty much all of our
dirhams. Its a good wage for twenty minutes of his time.
<p>
Elsa is almost the last vehicle on a crowded boat. We steam out of
Tangier and Sam is clearly upset to be leaving Africa.

I try and put on a brave face as we head into the Mediterranean.

I try and make Sam raise a smile as he stands at the stern and watches
Africa disappear in the distance.

As we get out someone spots dolphins behind us and we watch them
surface occasionally. 
<p>
Arriving at Algeciras there's a mad panic to get off. There's no
trouble at customs, except Sam is upset that we have to drive through
a shallow trench designed to wash off contamination from the underside
of cars, and Sam wants to keep as much of the Sahara on Elsa as long
as possible. Nobody checks us for contraband.
<p>
We head for Gibraltar and stock up with good british food in
Safeway. Then we cook it in the car park.

Sam notices something not right with the front left wheel. There's
fluid on the hub, and the dustcap covering the centre is split. He's
worried that he may have hit something and damaged the wheel. Its too
late to do anything about it now, and Sam decides we have to wait for
the garage to open to see if they can sort it out tomorrow. He doesn't
want to risk driving without it getting checked, so we find a quiet
corner of Gibraltar and park Elsa there.
<p>
We look for a pub for food, but its Saturday and everywhere is either
not serving food or is busy. We pop into one pub, ask to see the menu,
and then leg it when we decide we dont like the look of it. Eventually
we find an indian restaurant and I have a chili pakora starter -
something I've never seen in a restaurant back home!
<p>
We get back to Elsa and its gone midnight. The nearest public toilets
are locked so we have to hang on till morning. We're not supposed to
be camping there, so we make sure the road is clear and then quickly
all pile in to the back. Its quite an acrobatic performance to get the
three of us in.
