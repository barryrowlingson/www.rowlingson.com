Today we decide to have a quiet rest day in Erfoud. Sam and I wander
around and notice that every other car is a Land Rover. On one corner,
next to a big hotel, is a car park full of them.

They are all tour vehicles, designed to take people out to the
Erg Chebbi, the giant sand dune a few miles out of town. We are
pestered by a local man, who offers to guide us in town, and even
asks if Sam wants to sell his Land Rover. I dont think he was
joking.
<p>
We find a cybercafe and log in and check emails. Again, I have
trouble finding the right characters on the Arabic keyboard.
<p>
Back at the campsite, we put up Sam's army ponchos using Mike's
spare tent poles to make a shelter, and sit in the shade and read
while our laundry dries in the hot sun. It's a relaxing day.
