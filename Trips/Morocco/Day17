<h1>Day 17 - Erg Chebbi - the Sahara</h1>
<!-- Day 17 - Erg Chebbi - the Sahara -->
<!-- text here, from after the H1 to the end nav bits -->

Today we are going to see Erg Chebbi. As Saharan dunes go, its one of
the smallest, but its still the largest in Morocco. Mike and Carol
have seen it all before, and so decide to head off to the Cascades
d'Ouzoud. We plan to meet them there tomorrow. 
<p>
We pack everything up and head off to the dune. The going is good, and
we're following well-worn tracks in the scrub. There's quite a bit of
traffic heading down to the dune, including a bunch of Toyota Land
Cruisers which Sam takes great pleasure in overtaking.
<p>
There's a small hill in the distance. Is that it? As we approach it
becomes clear that its not a hill. Its a huge pile of sand. It goes on
for miles, and must be hundreds of feet high. We approach, stop on the
soft sand at the edge, and get out.

<p>
As usual, some children appear and take an interest. We let Abbie talk
to them while Sam and I explore the sands.

<p>
Further on, we find some palm trees and take more pictures of this
remarkable place.

Abbie stands on a dune and contemplates existence.

Elsa is now in what Sam hopes is her native habitat, despite having
mud tyres!

<p>

We drive off, and Sam must now be upset that this is as far south as
we will go, and from now on its all back North. 
<p>

<p>

As we head back to Erfoud, there's an unusual noise coming from the
front left side of Elsa. I get out and run along as Sam drives slowly,
and it seems to be coming from the wheel. Could be the brakes. We
drive slowly and carefully back to Erfoud to decide what to do.
<p>
We get back and hang out at the car park that was full of Land Rovers
yesterday. The same guide comes over to talk to us. We tell him we
need a mechanic, and he offers to take us to one. We drive off, and he
directs us to a mechanic's shack down a side street.
<p>
The mechanic adjusts the front brakes and bleeds off the brake
fluid. Luckily Sam brought plenty of hydraulic fluid for Elsa so we
didn't fill her up with what ever they had in stock. The mechanic then
guns Elsa down the road and slams on the brakes. The front wheels
lock, but the rear keep rolling. He pulls over and tells us that the
rear brakes need new pads. Sam had been told back in England that they
might need replacing, and now seems to be the time.
<p>
But the parts shop doesn't open until 4pm, we are told, so that gives
us about four hours in Erfoud. Our guide offers to show us the local
marble factory and fossil museum. We had tried our best to avoid these
tourist traps but now we seem to have been sucked into one. We wander
through town to the place. As we do, Abbie attracts a swarm of little
children, mostly boys, who give her little camels made from cleverly
twisted and woven palm fronds.
<p>
The marble factory is quite interesting. There's a huge saw that
slices metre-wide blocks of solid marble into 100 slices, with a huge
flywheel at one end, 100 blades at the other, and a continuous stream
of water flushing over it to keep it cool and wash out dust. It gets
through about 10cm a day, we are told. 
<p>
Then we get a quick tour of the craftsmen working the marble into
table tops,  chessboards, and other items. Then its into the shop.
<p>
We feel we have to buy something, but we try and spend as much time as
possible in there, looking at everything. Sam buys some hefty bookends
and I pick up some small fossil ammonites to make into pendants.
<p>
Our guide now insists we go to his cousin's carpet shop. We tell him
we don't want carpets, but Sam tells him that I have a house and need
lots of carpets. Thanks mate. Anyway, we end up in the basement of the
carpet shop, and drink mint tea while the guide's cousin rolls out his
wares and tells us how much better and cheaper they are than ones you
can get anywhere else. And then somewhere in the middle of all this,
he stops being his cousin and becomes his brother. Despite our guide
looking african, and the carpet salesman arabic. Most curious.
<p>
We get out of there without buying any carpets, but now we have our
guide's life story, told to us by his 'brother'. He used to be in the
army, until he smoked too much 'kif' (dope) and went a little mad. The
madness is now all under control, we are reassured.
<p>
We head back to the garage. By now Abbie has half a dozen palm
camels. She's obviously very popular.
<p>
Elsa is almost ready to go. The mechanic is hammering the brake pads
into place. And then its done.
<p>
But then there's the ritual of paying. Mint tea is served. A price is
agreed, and Sam is happy. He's also noticed the painted testimonials
to Nordine's mechanical skill on the garage door, and asks to add to
them. A pot of paint and a brush appears and Sam writes a few words on
the metal door.
<p>

<p>
In return, Nordine paints some arabic on the side of Elsa. We joke
that it says 'the drugs are in the back' or 'gullible brits', but its
actually a friendly greeting.
<p>
<img src="../Baz/landypaint.jpg" alt="Elsa gets a tattoo">
<p>
While all this is going on, I take some pictures of the local kids who
seem to enjoy hanging around the garage. 
<p>

<p>
Finally all the mechanics and children pose for more photographs, and
then we drive off.

<p>
We are more than glad to get out of Erfoud. But its getting
dark. We're heading up the Ziz valley and gorge but we're not seeing
the scenery. Driving on these roads is dangerous - if not for us, then
for the unlit cycles and mule carts that seem to appear out of nowhere
in front of us. Eventually Sam has had enough, and we don't blame
him. We pull over on a flat spot with rocks high up all around in the
darkness. There's nowhere to put the tent so we all pile in and sleep.
