We've still got a day or so spare in Morocco, so instead of heading
up to Tangier we decide to go south again and camp at Meknes for a
night. On route we stop for a break and I spot this butterfly, which, 
after ten minutes of fluttering around at the tops of the trees,
decides to perch itself in front of my close-up lens.

Its an <i>Iphiclides podalirius</i>, or Scarce Swallowtail.
<p>
We find the same campsite in Meknes that we stayed in two weeks
ago. There's a UK Land Rover there, and we chat to the couple and
their son, and swap desert stories.
<p>
We walk into town along the same streets again. A local passes by on a
classic 70's kids bike - a Raleigh Chopper! Sam considers running
after him and offering a few dirhams for what is probably a collectors
item back in England.
<p>
There's a cybercafe tucked away in a modern apartment that feels like
its someone's flat that has had networking installed and lets people
use it for a price. We spend some time sending messages home. I still
cant handle an arabic keyboard.
<p>
Sam decides he wants to buy some souvenirs, so its a haggling we will
go. After a while he emerges with a tagine dish and a very smelly
goat-leather footcushion cover. It stinks. At least my drum only
smells of cedar wood and is wrapped up. We've got goatskin stink all
the way back across Europe now.
<p>
We head back to camp for Sam to leave his treasures, and then he and
Abbie head back into town to find a restaurant - I dont fancy risking
the local scoff myself. So I sit and read until it gets dark and then
they return after having had tagines of some description in a nice
little restaurant.
<p>
Its now time to think about leaving Morocco.
