<h1>Day 30 - Home again</h1>
<!-- Day 30 - Sam Leaves Lancaster -->
<!-- text here, from after the H1 to the end nav bits -->

In the morning we get up and Sam gets to see what's changed in
Lancater since he was last here. We have lunch in the Whale Tail.
<p>
Sam gives me a lift up to campus, and the last I see of Elsa is a
trail of black smoke up the road as I reach journey's end.
