<h4>Randall Davis</h4>
<p>
Randall was the Principal Investigator for the project. He has worked
extensively with marine mammals for many years, including saving oiled
sea otters from the Exxon Valdez spill. 

<h4>Fred Weltz</h4>
<P>
Fred was brought up in L.A., but now resides in the cabin and makes
his living as a commercial fisherman. Fred met Randall when Randall
was living in an adjacent cabin on an otter study project, and
wandered past Fred's outhouse while Fred was otherwise occupied.
</P>

<h4>Lori and Rebecca</h4>
<p>
A great double act. Two graduate students from Randall's department at
Texas A+M University. They cooked and cleaned for us. They kept us in
Snickers bars and fruit drinks. They suffered our bad jokes and my
guitar playing. For the next team they had to cope without Randall, so
they were busy being trained to run the project without him. 

<h4>Bruce, Laura-Lee, Laura, Jim, and Diane - the volunteers.</h4>
<p>
That's in the order I met them.
<p>
 <b>Bruce</b> turned up while I was waiting
for the Anchorage flight to arrive in Cordova. He had been staying in
Cordova and so turned up just before the plane came in. Now retired,
he seems to spend all his time on Earthwatch and related projects,
with his trusty cameras, taking photographs of wildlife to fill his
album with.
<p>
<b>Laura-Lee</b> was the first to spot the 'Earthwatch' label on me as I
waited in the arrivals hall of Cordova Airport. She's a medical
student in North Carolina, and has a fondness for mud.
<p>
<b>Laura</b> is unemployed but seems to enjoy drifting between jobs with the
US National Park service. She hails from Connecticut and she enjoys
dressing up in Civil War costume.
<p>
<b>Jim</b> is another man of leisure, and interrupted his RV tour of Alaska
to do the project. He didn't bring his fishing gear, but managed to
borrow a rod from Fred and two lures from Barney. With two casts, he
managed to lose both lures in a stream full of salmon!
<p>
<b>Diane</b> works in Washington DC, but not for the government. She managed
to get our brains close to burnout with complex debates on life, the
universe, and everything in the evenings.

<h4>Barney and Maxine</h4>
<p>
Fred's parents. Although they are both well into their 80s, they still
enjoy the outdoor life. They were escaping from L.A. and staying in
a cabin on the other side of Alice Cove. In the morning Barney would
be out chopping wood, and later he'd be catching fish. They came over
to our cabin for dinner a couple of times, bringing the day's catch
for all to share.

<h4>Sonya</h4>
<p>
Three days before the end of the project, there was a visitor at the
door. Sonya is a journalist from Anchorage who was writing a piece on
the project. She interviewed us all and spoke at length to Randall and
Fred. I can't wait to read the finished article.
