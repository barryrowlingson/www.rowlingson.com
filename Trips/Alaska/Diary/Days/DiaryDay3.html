<h1>Sea Otter Diary - 25 July 
</h1>
<br clear=all>
<h2> Exploring Seattle and a Goth experience 
</h2>

Dave leaves me a map and house keys and goes off to work. I have
trouble finding my way out of the house and have to ask
directions. I'm on the wrong floor.
<p>
I decide to explore downtown, but first head out to the local
supermarket and get some snacks. I then follow the map to the sea-front
and the Pike Place market - a semi-open-air market selling all sorts of
stuff - fruit, vegetables, fish, meat, clothes, gifts etc. Then
there's a whole load more shops inside selling gifts and other
interesting items. I can't find anywhere in town that sells mini-DV
tapes - Radio Shack don't, Office World don't.
<p>
I'm also looking for rubber boots - wellies to us - so look round the
gigantic REI store. It's huge, but the shoe dept is very busy. I walk
back to Dave's place and find my way in no problem.
<p>
I watch TV for a while - Dave has cable so no shortage of channels -
and then he gets home. I phone Dave Howes (DH) in Tacoma, and he heads
over. We go to a Thai place near Dave Smith's (DS) flat. Good hot
food. Then DS leads us to a dark, quiet, empty bar where we are
stamped with the word 'GOTH' on our hands after paying the $3 entry
charge. The place is appropriately dead.
