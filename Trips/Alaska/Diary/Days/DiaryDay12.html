<h1>Sea Otter Diary - 3 Aug 
</h1>
<br clear=all>
<h2> Blondes and bears 
</h2>

We're now well into the morning routine. Today my team is on the boat
with Randall, doing photo-identification work. We see a very blonde
otter and a mum with a golden pup. In all we photograph 16 hopefully
different otters. Randall takes to a small inlet lagoon where he once
kept 6 otters captive for a month to study their habits. We wander
around for a bit and Bruce nearly falls in when pushing us off. 
<p>
We get back to the cabin for a burrito lunch. Then its off again - we
follow a couple of otters including a female with a pup. She does
about a dozen dives which we time and note. We head up the bay but are
distracted by a brown bear on the shore. A black bear appears as we
try and find the brown one. He disappears into the woods and we head
back to camp.
<p>
Before dinner we do some more filtering of grab samples. Its mostly
mud this time. I'm filled with pasta for dinner while the others tuck
into chili. There's much debate into the evening as to what time to
start tomorrow. Our heads hit the pillows about 10pm.
