<h1>Sea Otter Diary - 27 July 
</h1>
<br clear=all>
<h2> Shopping in Seattle 
</h2>

I find Ken's Cameras open this morning and buy 10 DV tapes, and I get
them for the price of 9. I then spend a few minutes with some scissors
taking all the tapes out of their monstrous packaging.
<p>
I wander all along the waterfront and up the the Seattle Center - site
of a world's fair and the space needle. It's a bit busy and also quite
cloudy and hazy so I skip the needle and just relax in the park.
<p>
I walk back into town, following the line of the monorail that was
built to take people to the World's Fair. Once back among the tower
blocks I take a whole lot of video famous brand names for a music
video I want to film. I wander round a small mall taking shots of all
the prestigious brand names.
<p>
In the evening DH turns up and the 3 of us drive off and pick up
Geoff, then we head to the George and Dragon where I have a cheese
sandwich and chips. The place sells English beer and is full of
non-americans.
