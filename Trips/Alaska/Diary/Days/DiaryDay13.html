<h1>Sea Otter Diary - 4 Aug 
</h1>

<h2> Exploring the shore, and a surprise visitor  
</h2>

Sometime in the night I'm awakened by a noise outside. The
high-pitched squeal of a baby otter is now a familiar noise to us, but
not in the cove. There must be a mother feeding there. I listen to its
calls for a while - they start when mother dives, and stop when she
returns with a splash and hopefully a morsel for baby. I fall asleep
to the calls.
<p>
Its a slightly cloudy morning as we get up. Today its an easy day
visiting the tide pools. I'm in the whaler with Laura-lee, Diane and
Jim with Lori at the helm. For our first stop we bob alongside a rock
wall where starfish cling and a small worm intrigues Rebecca. Next we
head along the coast to Sheep Point where we get out for a wander
round. It is hard not to tread on the starfish that litter the
rocks. Lori points out the various species. She shows us one that has
reversed its stomach to digest some unfortunate prey. Fred picks up a
crab, which promptly sheds one of its legs to escape, and runs away
seeming none the worse for losing a limb. Fred is left holding the
leg. Someone spots an eagle's nest, and we watch the adults return to
the young. Beyond the tree we see a very blonde otter with a pup,
feeding in the still waters of the point. 
<p>
As we head off, there's a noise. The tide had risen as we wandered and
covered the anchor, which we'd forgotten to lift. It wrapped around
the propeller. We free it up and head off, promising not to tell Randall.
<p>
Back at the cabin we have an early lunch and then head out with Fred
to do some more sampling, stopping to film some otters on the way out
to the site. The wind picks up and the water gets a bit choppy. We get
soaked heading back. The samples get sieved and bagged on the shore. 
We all sit in the cabin and snack as dinner is prepared - its curry
night. Not quite authentic but great nevertheless.
<p>
As we're sitting digesting dinner there's someone at the door. It's
Sonya. She's a journalist from Anchorage. With her is Mark King, a
local fisherman who has brought her out from Cordova in his boat. . He's a friend of
Fred's, but then Cordova is a small town where I guess everyone knows
everyone else. 
<p>
Sonya has arrived a day early. Randall was expecting her
tomorrow. She's writing a piece on the Earthwatch project. Armed with
her minidisc recorder she's going to be taking notes and talking to us
while observing our work. Tonight she is treated to Randall and Mark
discussing otter predation and mortality. Mark is an Eyak native who
has lived here all his life. The talk continues into the night as we
head off down to the tent for bed.
