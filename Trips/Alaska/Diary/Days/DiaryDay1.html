<h1>Sea Otter Diary - 23 July 
</h1>
<br clear=all>
<h2> A sea otter surprise in Windsor Great Park 
</h2>

A sunny day, and I get the train to Reading on time. The connection to
Egham is cancelled, but the next one is only 20 minutes later. Its an
empty commuter train to heading to Waterloo to pick up office workers.
<p>
Arrive at Egham. Town seems more pedestrianised than I
remember. There's a new road or two. I find the back road up to
college again. There are new accommodation buildings and I find my way
round them to the reception office. There's a Canadian marching band
heading into Athlone Hall. Luckily I don't have to queue behind all 200
of them.
<p>
I get my room key, number X11 in one of the new blocks close to my old
residence in Williamson House. A small room with a TV, a shower/toilet
in a corner cubicle, and the usual student room fixtures and fittings.
<p>
Walk round campus a bit - physics has moved out of the old building. I
cross the A30 and head for Windsor Great Park. My old favourite tree
seems to have gone. I sit by the lake and have some food, watch
birds. Walk up to the totem pole - a gift from Canadian pacific coast
natives to the queen - and there's a sea otter half way up
it. Smiling, I head back to college and bed.
