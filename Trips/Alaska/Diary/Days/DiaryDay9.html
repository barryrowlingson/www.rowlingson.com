<h1>Sea Otter Diary - 31 July 
</h1>
<br clear=all>
<h2> Down to work - dropping the camera, and a little light music. 
</h2>

There's a lot of rain during the night. It's still raining by morning.
The cloud has lifted a bit and now we can see a bit more of the
mountains across the bay. Up to the cabin for breakfast.
<p>
Randall divides us into two teams for the work. LauraLee, Bruce and
myself are one team, Laura, Jim and Diane make up the other. Today
we're working with Fred in the skiff doing bottom camera data
collecting, and the others are out in the whaler with Randall doing
the photo-identification and otter behaviour study.
<p>
On the way out to the survey site, Fred spots a black bear on the
shore. We watch it spot us and disappear into the trees.
<p>
Once we get to the station marked on the chart we lower the camera
into the water. Its a small black-and-white camera attached to a metal
plate together with a battery-powered torchlight for illumination. The
plate is lowered on a rope and a cable brings back the camera
picture. This is plugged into a box on the boat which holds the
electronics and the screen. A fabric hood over the screen lets the
viewer see what's going on in bright light.
<p>
We all take turns hauling the camera up and down together with coiling
the cable carefully and looking at the screen. We see mostly mud but
there are some odd little creatures and encrustations on the
sea-bottom. For some reason I seem to describe them all in terms of
food - small holes surrounded by debris look to me like bagels or
doughnuts, mud has the texture of orange peel, and some seaweed looks
a lot like cabbage. There are also these amazing feathery sea pens
that sprout up from the mud.
<p>
We hear on the radio from Randall that they've been following an otter
for for a while, and they want to know what sort of surface its been
diving to. We head over and take a look at the bottom. Its soon
lunchtime so back to the camp where Randall fries up some beans to
make some burritos. He likes his hot food.
<p>
There's much discussion between Randall and Fred about what to do in
the afternoon. Eventually its decided we should do some more
investigation of the bottom where the otter was doing dives up to four
minutes. Once we get out there Fred's depth-finder tells us its 70
metres deep. That's at the limit of the camera cable length, and quite
a long haul to get the camera up. The light fails on the camera, so we
replace the battery. Fred's depth-finder fails and he can't fix it
there and then. It's now time to get back to camp.
<p>
We clean up the equipment and return to the cabin for dinner. It's our
group's turn to help with the cooking and cleaning. 
<p>
Fred's parents, Barney and Maxine, turn up. They are staying in the
cabin across the cove for a while. It beats Los Angeles, I guess. 
<p>
After dinner, Fred is encouraged to get his guitars from the Dancing
Bear and he and I go over and pick up 2 guitars, an amp, and a
mixer. We set it all up in the cabin and play a few songs for the
audience, with limited audience participation. We get to bed about 11.
