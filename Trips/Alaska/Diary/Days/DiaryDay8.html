<h1>Sea Otter Diary - 30 July 
</h1>
<br clear=all>
<h2> Otters, eagles, bears and salmon 
</h2>

I wake up at about 6:15 and its still light - I don't recall it ever
getting dark. I crawl out of my sleeping bag at 7:45 and there's an
otter in the Cove. Jim and Bruce are up watching it. It's the first
one we've seen. There are also eagles flying around, and fish
jumping. It's raining slightly, and there's still a lot of low cloud
around.  Once everyone is up, we head up to the cabin for breakfast -
there's cereals and toast and other goodies. 
<p>
Randall tries to show us a presentation on the computer but the
projector blows a lamp. Instead we have to all try and look at the
laptop screen. Its just the outline of the project, pretty much what
we should have all read in the project briefing. Then its down to the
beach for equipment and safety demos. We're shown how the various bits
of kit operate - the GPS, the VHF radios, the drop camera, the Eckman
grab, the laser binoculars.  Once that's done its already time for
lunch up at the cabin.
<p>
 After that we head out on the boats. There are
two craft we are using for the trip. One is a wooden skiff with a
pointed bow, which was built by Fred in the cabin. He normally goes
out in this one. The other is a plastic or fibre-glass boat referred
to as the Boston Whaler - that's the manufacturer. I think you'd have
trouble catching whales in it. Randall prefers this craft, probably
because it has a much larger engine and flies through the water.
<p>
We head up the left arm of Simpson Bay - and there are otters all over
the water. We also spot a brown bear on a small island. There are bald
eagles sitting in seemingly every other tree. Quite a few of
the otters are mothers with small pups, and we stop next to one as she
feeds and grooms it for half an hour. Other otters are less tolerant,
and dive off as we approach.
<p>
There are some harbour seals hauled out of the water, sitting on
rocks. As we get closer they become agitated, and eventually slope off
into the water. Jellyfish drift past the boat. Salmon jump.
<p>
We land the boats on some mudflats for a look around. It has quite a
smell to it. Then its across the bay to a small waterfall, where
there's plenty of sign of bears feeding on the local berries. A short
scramble up the stream leads to a larger waterfall. 
<p>
By now its nearly dinner time, so we zoom back to camp and eat. I talk
to Randall about some statistical analysis he is doing with some
Weddell seal skull measurements. Soon its bedtime.
