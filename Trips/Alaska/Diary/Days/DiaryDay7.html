<h1>Sea Otter Diary - 29 July 
</h1>
<br clear=all>
<h2> Off to Alaska and the great rendezvous 
</h2>

I get up at 6 and pack my sleeping and wash gear. At 6.30 Dave gets up
and we drive to the airport. Check in and boarding go okay, but I have
to change seats at Yakutat! The views are stunning - mountains,
glaciers, ocean. The plane stops at Juneau and Yakutat before arriving
at Cordova on time. The airport is one small building. I film the
plane leaving and watch a few small aircraft come and go.
<p>
I sit down at the River Rafter's Lodge which is the rendezvous, but of
course I am four hours early. So I sit and wait and watch the planes
arriving, the flowers waving in the wind, and the insects buzzing
round the flowers. The sun shines for a bit, and it rains a bit
too. Not too bad.
<p>
At 3.30 Bruce arrives. He unloads all his bags from the hired car he
has and takes it back to the rental shack. He then shows me some
photographs he has taken on other trips - tigers, big cats, whales. We
talk for a while as we wait for the plane to arrive.
<p>
The Alaska Air 737 returns so I go and stand in the lobby with a big
Earthwatch tag sticking out of my top pocket. First to spot me is
Laura-Lee. Then Laura notices it. Then Jim says hi. No sign of Diane,
so we head back to the lodge and Diane is just ahead of us. We're all
together for the first time so its greetings all round.
<p>
We wait for someone to meet us. For a while. At 5.15 Bruce heads off
to the car rental shop. He comes back, and tells us that he's found
out that Cordova Air are expecting us by 6 o'clock. At 5.30 Bruce's
impatience gets the better of him and he goes to find out what's
happening. He returns to tell us that Robyn has forgotten that she has
to pick us up, and is rushing out to get us.
<p>
Robyn arrives shortly afterwards and we all pile into the big old bus
and start the journey to the lake. She tells us a bit about the
history of the Copper River Delta and something about the
wildlife. Its now raining quite heavily. We get to Lake Eyak and the
rain is easing off slightly. I throw my gear into a plane with the two
Lauras and the others jump into the next plane. Our pilot seems
slightly eccentric, but that's what I'd expect from an Alaskan bush
pilot. We accelerate off and then we're in the air. I can see the
other plane taking off beside us, but there's not much of a view out
of the front. 
<p>
We do a big left turn and head back over the bus. Then we cross
Cordova harbour and out across the ocean. A short hop over a small
island brings us to Simpson Bay, and we make a soft landing and then
both the planes cruise into Alice Cove. We hit the beach and jump out,
where we're greeted by Randall, Fred, Lori and Rebecca.
<p>
First thing to arrange is the accommodation. There's a tent for two and
a tent for four, and we are three guys and three girls. Randall makes
an executive decision to put me in the tent with the three girls - I'm
not complaining. Bruce and Jim have the small tent on the left, and
the four of us are in the bigger tent on the right. We jump in and
grab a bunk each. Randall shows us the facilities - heater, water. 
I pop over to the guys' tent to see how much room they have. Not a lot
it seems!
<p>
We head up to Fred's cabin. This is where Randall, Lori, and Rebecca
sleep. Fred has been evicted and spends nights on his boat, the
Dancing Bear, moored just out in the Cove. Rebecca and Lori have
prepared some snacks and dinner, which we eat and then head back down
to the beach to sort out our sleeping bags and gear and settle down
for a night's sleep.
