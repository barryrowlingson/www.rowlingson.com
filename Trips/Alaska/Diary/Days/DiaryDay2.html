<h2> Across the Atlantic and sleeping in Seattle  
</h2>

Get up at 7.30 and have breakfast in the kitchen. The drivers from the
marching band are there - they sound Dutch or German. I head for the
bus stop to catch the 8:41 bus to the airport, aware that the woman at
reception had told me that they weren't that reliable, and I decide
I'll get a taxi if its not there by 9:15. It's only 12 minutes late
when it arrives.
<p>
I nearly leave my hat on the bus at the airport, but the bloke behind
me picks it up and returns it. I head for terminal 4. I'm very early,
so I wander around a bit, take some video footage. Check in, and then
I'm through security and on the plane. Next to me is a couple from
Newcastle-Upon-Tyne who used to live in Botswana. The flight is the
usual dullness, except when I look up and see a radio telescope on the
screen. Its a film called 'The Dish' about the radio telescope that
received the first TV transmissions from Apollo 11 on the moon. Its
quite funny, especially in the Australian depiction of the US
people. A strange choice for a flight to the states.
<p>
Arrive at Seattle Airport on time - its 3pm or so. I get my luggage
and head for customs. Bloke there checks my boots for foot-n-mouth
infected mud and asks where I've been walking. He seems happy with
them and lets me through. Also in the queue was a bunch of girls who
are returning from a soccer tour of Europe, and are worried that they
will all have to dig their muddy boots out of their bags for
inspection.
<p>
Immigrations is straight through, and then a small shuttle bus takes
me to the main terminal. I find some US currency and stick a couple of
quarters in the phone and call Dave Smith. I get his answering machine
and leave a message. A little while later I try again. Same
message. Then I wait a while and try yet again. This time the message
has changed to tell me that he's on his way. Shortly after he appears
at the baggage carousel (not down the conveyor belt). We head off to
the garage and drive back to his flat just out of downtown Seattle. I
check my email and sleep on the couch.
