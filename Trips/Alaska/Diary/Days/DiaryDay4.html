<h2> Sea Otters in the Aquarium 
</h2>

On the way to the bar last night I spotted an army surplus store. I
return to it first thing this morning and find some well-fitting
wellies. I drop them back at Dave's and go downtown. I find Ken's
Cameras, hoping it has some DV tapes, but it's closed because of some
power cut problem. Great.
<p>There's an
aquarium down on the waterfront - Seattle Aquarium no less. I go in
and head straight for the sea otters. There's four in a tank, just
floating there and enjoying the sun. One of the adults is holding
hands with one of the juveniles and everyone is just melting when they
notice. How many other furry animals hold hands like that?
<p>
There's also river otters, northern fur seals, harbour seals, octopus,
various fish, anemones, shellfish etc. Its now feeding time for the
fish in the big dome. Two divers are distributing fish food and the
dome is full of excited children.
<p>
I head back to the sea otters for their feeding time. They've woken up
a bit from earlier and are now swimming around and grooming. The two
adult otters are clearly different sexes, and we get a close up view
of the mating behaviour of the sea otter. Junior just rolls around in
a corner.
<p>
Two aquarium staff turn up and throw scraps for the sea otters. One of
them gets out and wobbles around a bit on land - it doesn't look very
happy - and plops back in again. It then tries to chew the base of the
pole belonging to a net that one of the staff has. Next to the tank is
a staff member with a table of furs. The sea otter fur feels so much
softer than anything else, and the value of its pelt is suddenly
apparent. 
<p>
After a while wandering around the aquarium, I find my way back to
Dave's flat. When he gets home he says we're off to see a friend of
his who is visiting Seattle for a while. We grab some Mexican take-out
and then get hopelessly lost trying to find where Cindy is
staying. After phoning her for directions we finally get there. It's a
beautiful large house with a balcony overlooking Lake Washington where
we sit and drink and eat. Cindy's daughter has some friends over and
we hear them splashing around in the big hot tub. We chat until it
gets dark and then go home.
