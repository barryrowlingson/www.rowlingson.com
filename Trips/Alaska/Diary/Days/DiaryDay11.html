<h1>Sea Otter Diary - 2 Aug

<h2> Mud, mud, glorious mud, and a walk in the forest 
</h2>

Its up and breakfast as usual. Today we're out on Fred's boat doing
bottom  grab sampling. We use the GPS to get onto the station and
deploy the grab. The first few grabs go okay with Bruce on the line 
but then it fails to close up at all when Fred has a go. And
again. And again. He tries dropping the weight onto the grab from
about a foot up, and it triggers fine. He drops it in the water again,
hurls the messenger down, and pulls it back up. It still hasn't
grabbed. 
<p>
So I have a go. And it fails twice. This is getting infuriating. We
put Bruce on the rope and we finally get a sample. We let Bruce do all
the work from then on! I'm busy coiling the rope, and Laura-Lee does
the bagging and recording. Fred does his best to keep us on the GPS
station point.
<p>
Its another glorious sunny day, so we amble back slowly for lunch and
stop to watch some otters on the way.
<p>
After lunch we have Rebecca steering. She's getting used to handling
the boat. We see a Mom and Pup pair diving and feeding so we radio the
other boat to put them on to it. 
<p>
We carry on with the bottom sampling. Laura-Lee is clearly enjoying
the mud - she now not only has samples in the zip-loc bag, but also
over her white t-shirt. She writes 'MUD' in big letters across it, and
leaves a couple of hand-prints. I join in by doing warpaint stripes
across my face. 
<p>
At 5pm we make for a rocky shore and get off the boat to hike the
short distance back to the cove. I have the coordinates of the camp in
my GPS so I know how far it is! There's plenty of bear scat in the
forest. Delicate flowers grow on the wet bog. We emerge from the woods
to the beach in sight of the camp and stroll along the shaley sand
past a few cabins and back to the tents.
<p>
Randall has been over at Fred's parent's cabin sipping gin. It's a
hard life for a Principal Investigator. He turns up at our camp and we
unload the mud samples and equipment. I have a quick wash in the cold
mountain water from the hose at the beach. I wash my mud off, but
Laura-Lee is treasuring hers.
<p>
I'm filled with pasta and sauce for dinner, topped off with delicious
bread pudding. Randall cracks open the cheap brandy - in a plastic
bottle - to pour on top. He and Fred discuss the merits of generators
as the data is entered.
