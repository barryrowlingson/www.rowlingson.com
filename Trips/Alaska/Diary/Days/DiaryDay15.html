<h1>Sea Otter Diary - 6 Aug

<h2> Walking the shore and grabbing the bottom again 
</h2>

An early start for the shoreline survey. Randall explains how we are
to document the shore between low and high tide marks using cameras
and GPS units to record features. We take the boat out to the next
stretch of coast to survey, in the left fork of Simpson Bay. I'm using
my GPS to give coordinates to LauraLee who is note-taking at
first. Randall strolls along, describing the mud, the sand, and the
rocky substrate. There's lots of mud. LauraLee sits down in it at one
point. It grabs Bruce's boots and he walks right out of them. Diane
poses as Miss Rocky Substrate 2001. 
<p>
We wander the shore, taking pictures looking along and back every so
often, and marking notable features such as rocks with GPS
readings. We find lots of mussels much like what yesterday's otter
must have been feeding on. They are hard to remove from the rocks, and
we marvel at the otter's ability.
<p>
After a couple of miles on foot Fred shows us a small spring of
wonderful cool fresh water, which we name Fred's Fountain. By now its
lunchtime to we head back to camp, and Fred stops at every otter we
see so I can get some more film and Bruce can take some photographs.
As we get into Alice Cove we see Barney waving to us on the far
shore. Fred takes the skiff over and Barney shows off his catch - a
halibut ready for the pot, given a large enough pot! He offers to
bring some over for tea tonight.
<p>
We have a very lazy lunch - I while away the time balancing rocks on
the shore while some of the others relax on the sun lounger that forms
'Club Med' for us. Randall is probably having a siesta up in the
cabin. It has been a warm and sunny day. 
<p>

Eventually we get some energy back and head up with Fred to the left
side of the right arm of Simpson Bay where we saw the otter
yesterday. Randall wants to see what the bottom is like where the
animal was feeding. We take some bottom samples while Randall's crew
drop the camera down and unsurprisingly see lots of mussels. 
<p>
While we work another boat with a small family on board zooms past us
into the lagoon, and five minutes later zooms back again. We head up
into the lagoon to see if anything is going on, and because Randall
wants to pick berries.
<p>
Some zip-loc bags intended for mud samples are requisitioned as berry
bags. People get down to the important business of picking fruit once
Randall has told us what the best ones look like. Fred suggests we
wander upstream to a waterfall he knows, but a short way there he
spies some fresh bear prints. The bear may not be too happy about us
taking his fruit. We walk back to get some more berries. Several
people have full bags now, and Randall is king of the berry pickers.
<p>
We take the boats back out of the lagoon and now there is an otter
diving and feeding right where we were doing the survey earlier. Its
probably the same otter that we saw yesterday. He dives down, pops up,
and crunches mussels, turning over to get more out of the pockets of
skin under his arms, and crunching them. Then its down again for a few
more armfuls. Randall gets some pictures. By now its late and time to
get home. 
<p>
Its gone six before we arrive back, and dinner is getting
ready. Barney's fish is cooking and the berries we picked have been
turned into a fruit cobbler. That means lots of washing up for us.
<p>
There's some excitement later in the evening as Mark, the fisherman
who brought Sonya here, arrives to tell us of a ship sinking out in
the bay. We listen in to the emergency channel on the shortwave and
watch a rescue helicopter heading out. After a while it seems the crew
are all okay. We head down to the tents on the shore and Mark's boat
is moored there, where he stays for the night.
