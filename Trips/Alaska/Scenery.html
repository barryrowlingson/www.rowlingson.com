<H3>Scenery</H3>
<P>
Snow-capped mountains reaching down to the ocean. Craggy peaks towering
over deep green forests. Distant hills reflected in mirror seas.
<p>
From the plane flying to Cordova from Seattle you can see that Alaska
is big. The mountains go on to the horizon. The glaciers shine up at
you, green and turquoise. From the ground you are more <i>in</i> the
scenery than looking at it. 
<p>

For most of the bay, the mountains are wooded down to the water, where
a small strip of tidal beach draws a thin gray line between the green
and the blue. The woods seem impenetrable to humans, but the bears
must know the way through the densely packed fallen trees and
undergrowth. Following them to learn their paths would seem foolish
though. 
<p>
The beaches consist of gray shale gravel, with occasional rock
formations. In the tidal pools we found hundreds of starfish, some small
crabs, and a few little fish. 
<p>
As part of the work for the project we did some surveying of the study
area. During low tide we walked a section of shoreline, with Randall
noting the change in shoreline type - from say, gravel to mud. 
We would log the position and take digital photos of the
beach. Eventually Randall hopes to have a complete detailed database
of the inter-tidal region in Simpson Bay.
<p>
Another phase of the work was surveying the bottom of the bay. This is
where the otters feed so it is essential to know what is going on down
there. We used two techniques to probe the depths. Firstly, a small
camera and torchlight mounted on a plate were lowered down from the
boat. A screen mounted in a box on the boat displayed the pictures
from the camera. As the boat drifted along slowly the viewer would
describe the scene - mud, gravel, rocks and various small creatures.
<p>
We also used an Eckman grab to take samples of the sediments on the
bottom. This device is lowered to the ocean bed, and once the operator
is happy that it is lying square on the surface a length of pipe is
dropped down the line. This triggers the grab to close and a portion
of whatever it is sitting on is captured. The unit is hauled up and
the sample is bagged.
<p>
Well, that's the theory. Sometimes the grab jams on a rock and comes
back empty. Or the jaws don't close. But that tells you something
about the surface. A good grab brings up a couple of handfuls of mud
or gravel. Occasionally we'd find something interesting, like a clam
or small starfish.
<p>
Once back at base we put the samples through a series of filters to
determine the amount of gravel through to fine sand. Once all the
survey stations in the bay are done, the plan is to correlate otter
behaviour with sea bottom type.
