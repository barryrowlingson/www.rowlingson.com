<p>
Sitting next to a snuffling, cold-infested person on an overnight flight eastbound over
three time zones is enough to make you consider flying Business Class, or the cheaper alternative
which is getting a private pilot's license and buying your own plane. Sadly my finances did
not extend to this and I arrived at Boston Airport to be greeted by Rebecca and to pass on to her
the fine collection of viruses that were deposited on me by Mr Snot while I tried to sleep at 
an altitude of 35,000 feet. Of course the recirculating air in the cabin meant that he wasn't 
singling me out for this treatment, but only I could hear his throat-clearing noises every 
two minutes.
</p>
<p>I met Rebecca six years ago when I was working on the <a href="http://www.earthwatch.org">Earthwatch</a> 
team for <a href="/Trips/Alaska/">Sea Otters Of Alaska</a>. She was one of the PhD student assistants roped
in by Randy to help out. I was one of the volunteers paying good money to do the actual work. Rebecca was
in Boston for some training for her new job back in California and was happy to arrange a trip north into New Hampshire 
to see the Fall colours.
</p>
<p>

        <div class="caption">hire car</div>
        </div>
        
So from the early morning airport reunion we went back to the apartment she has rented and I promptly fell
asleep as she went off to work. She came back about 3pm and I woke up and got ready to go. Since it was a holiday 
weekend (Columbus Day) we had three days off to explore the countryside. First we headed back
into town and got a coach ticket to Manchester (note that most of the place names in New Hampshire are 
English in origin, I won't bother pointing this out again). To get a coach ticket requires that you present some
ID, which I found rather strange. Was the FBI tracking us? Did Homeland Security need to know if potential
terrorists were going to see the autumn leaves for some reason? Anyway, they let us on the bus without any
security checks after that, and we were off to Manchester.
</p>
<p>
It being a holiday weekend there was traffic, lots of traffic, and we were running late. Rebecca's plan
was to hire a car in Manchester, since that was cheaper than hiring one in Boston. She phoned the hire company
to tell them we were running a bit late and to make sure she could still pick up the car she had already reserved, 
to discover that the incompetent fools there had thought she was turning up at 3pm and not 6pm. Consequently
they had already hired the car out to someone else. We were dumped in Manchester by the bus, a few hundred
miles from our accomodation for the night and with no transport.
</p>
<p>
So we had to think on our feet. By getting a taxi to the airport we might be able to find a hire car, and failing 
that airports always have cheap hotels so we could find somewhere for the night. A local taxi dropped us off at the
terminal and we found a car at the third desk we enquired at - a Dodge Caliber, a marvellously flimsy plastic piece
of engineering (Rebecca has a Merc waiting for her back in California, and I drive a 1983 Series III Land Rover).
</p>
<p>
Anyway, the Dodge got us to Lincoln, and the <a href="http://www.kancmotorlodge.com/">Kancamagus Motor Lodge</a> well 
after dark. We had a room with a fine air of stale tobacco and a steam bath (which I suppose we could have used 
to fumigate the tobacco essence from the room, but it would have required enough steam to power a Mississippi showboat and an
oil tanker full of fragrant oil). Sleep was a welcome relief - except the rattly old aircon did its best to keep us awake.
</p>

        <div class="caption">Breakfast</div>
        </div>
        
Morning brought us our first views of the trees that decorate the lower slopes of the White Mountains with their 
infinite variations of colour - green, red, brown, yellow, gold - a full and ever-changing palette. We recharged our stomachs
with bagels, juice, and coffee at a sweet little bagel shop at some early hour and drove over to the start of the Falling Waters trail.
This path headed up past waterfalls to the Franconia Ridge. The car park was busy but not full, with walkers
tying up boots and pulling on rucksacks ready to hit the trail.
The path heads up to the Franconia Ridge through forest and past waterfalls. After a couple of hours you break out of
the forest near the summit of Little Haystack Mountain at 4840ft elevation.
</p>

<p>
Eventually you reach the summit. Careful choice of camera angle can hide the fact that we were sharing this summit
with about 200 other people. We were never alone on this walk up, with people always either visible above or below, or
audible closeby. The sounds of the forest interrupted by loud conversations, the tapping of hiking poles on rocks, and
the dripping of sweat from hard-working brows. This is a busy trail, so much so that some rocks are scratched white from the 
countless impacts of tungsten-carbide tips.
</p>

<p>
From Little Haystack a fine airy ridge extends north to Mount Lincoln and then Mount Lafayette at 5260ft elevation, the high point
of the walk. This summit was so busy it was nearly impossible to get photographs without bright rucksacks and 
baseball caps spoiling the scenery.

We left the summit heading west and stopped briefly at <a
href="http://www.outdoors.org/lodging/huts/huts-greenleaf.cfm">Greenleaf
Hut</a> to refill our rapidly emptying water bottles. The hut offers food, drink, and lodging as well as an
outside deck occupied by people enjoying the warm sunshine and the expansive views. We didn't loiter too long since
the clouds were gathering across the valley. The descent was less busy than the hike up, with even a 
feeling of space and solitude in places. This rapidly disappeared as we got back to the car, with the car park
now overflowing with people parking on any flat piece of grass. We drove back to Lincoln for coffee and cake. The 
rain came down, heavy. We studied our tourist map from the shelter of a warm coffee shop and planned the next day.
</p>
<p>

        <div class="caption">Warren Village Inn</div>
        </div>
        
We only had one night in the tobacco-infested lodge, and so as darkness fell we drove out of Lincoln to 
the <a href="http://www.warrenvillageinn.com/">Warren Village Inn</a>, a large Victorian family home now a 
bed and breakfast. Our room was clean, tidy, and had a floral aroma with a slightly woody base note plus hints
of pine and sandalwood. No tobacco.
</p>
<p>
After yesterday's hike we decided to take it easy and to go see some of the tourist trails around Lincoln.
"The Flume" was a couple of miles that took in a narrow waterfall, glacial boulders, a covered bridge, a wolf's den,
a bear cave, and a philosopher's pool.
</p>

<p>
I should explain the covered bridge thing. In New Hampshire there appears to be a tradition of building bridges with roofs - covered 
bridges. There doesn't seem to be an agreed reason for this tradition. It may shelter the bridge from the weather, and
it may stop animals being scared on bridges since they can't see the drop and also are fooled into thinking they are going
indoors. However there's extra weight and cost in building a covered bridge. Anyhow, Rebecca has some sort of 
mild obsession with the things, and got unnaturally excited when we saw one - I won't describe her excitement
when we actually <i>drove</i> across one in the Dodge.
</p>

<p>
Wherever you go in New Hampshire you can't fail to notice the profile of The Old Man Of The Mountain. He is a rock
formation that presents a craggy profile of a craggy old man, complete with square jaw and squarer hat. We headed
off to the visitor centre to see this phenomenon. 
</p>
<div class="gallery"><p><a href="images/Photographs/imgp0814.jpg" class="smoothbox" rel="gallery" title="Trees and cloud"><img src="images/Thumbnails/imgp0814.jpg" alt="Trees and cloud" /><i>Trees and cloud</i></a></p><p><a href="images/Photographs/imgp0822.jpg" class="smoothbox" rel="gallery" title="Old man lake"><img src="images/Thumbnails/imgp0822.jpg" alt="Old man lake" /><i>Old man lake</i></a></p><p><a href="images/Photographs/imgp0826.jpg" class="smoothbox" rel="gallery" title="Old man sign"><img src="images/Thumbnails/imgp0826.jpg" alt="Old man sign" /><i>Old man sign</i></a></p></div>
<p>
And then we discovered something. The Old Man's face fell off in 2003. Its gone. They're not restoring it, instead
they are building a memorial. We should have figured that out from all the signs saying 'Old Man Memorial Construction' 
everywhere. Or the small print on the side of the big map at the visitor's centre that told how a storm had caused the 
collapse. Or from the fact that there 
wasn't a great deal of people there. Boy did we feel dumb. In a funny way. We laughed our faces off.
</p>
<div class="gallery"><p><a href="images/Photographs/imgp0825.jpg" class="smoothbox" rel="gallery" title="Old Man was here"><img src="images/Thumbnails/imgp0825.jpg" alt="Old Man was here" /><i>Old Man was here</i></a></p><p><a href="images/Photographs/imgp0836.jpg" class="smoothbox" rel="gallery" title="Consolation snacks"><img src="images/Thumbnails/imgp0836.jpg" alt="Consolation snacks" /><i>Consolation snacks</i></a></p></div>

<p>Still, plenty of time in the day yet to enjoy more of the fall colours. We'd arrived at possibly the best weekend
for viewing this world-famous seasonal sight.
</p>
<div class="gallery"><p><a href="images/Photographs/imgp0829.jpg" class="smoothbox" rel="gallery" title="Fall colours"><img src="images/Thumbnails/imgp0829.jpg" alt="Fall colours" /><i>Fall colours</i></a></p><p><a href="images/Photographs/imgp0870.jpg" class="smoothbox" rel="gallery" title="Reds and greens"><img src="images/Thumbnails/imgp0870.jpg" alt="Reds and greens" /><i>Reds and greens</i></a></p><p><a href="images/Photographs/imgp0830.jpg" class="smoothbox" rel="gallery" title="Reds and yellows"><img src="images/Thumbnails/imgp0830.jpg" alt="Reds and yellows" /><i>Reds and yellows</i></a></p><p><a href="images/Photographs/imgp0832.jpg" class="smoothbox" rel="gallery" title="Greens and reds"><img src="images/Thumbnails/imgp0832.jpg" alt="Greens and reds" /><i>Greens and reds</i></a></p><p><a href="images/Photographs/imgp0833.jpg" class="smoothbox" rel="gallery" title="Just red"><img src="images/Thumbnails/imgp0833.jpg" alt="Just red" /><i>Just red</i></a></p><p><a href="images/Photographs/imgp0837.jpg" class="smoothbox" rel="gallery" title="Yellows and reds"><img src="images/Thumbnails/imgp0837.jpg" alt="Yellows and reds" /><i>Yellows and reds</i></a></p><p><a href="images/Photographs/imgp0840.jpg" class="smoothbox" rel="gallery" title="Trees on cliff"><img src="images/Thumbnails/imgp0840.jpg" alt="Trees on cliff" /><i>Trees on cliff</i></a></p><p><a href="images/Photographs/imgp0841.jpg" class="smoothbox" rel="gallery" title="Clifftop trees with cloud"><img src="images/Thumbnails/imgp0841.jpg" alt="Clifftop trees with cloud" /><i>Clifftop trees with cloud</i></a></p><p><a href="images/Photographs/imgp0842.jpg" class="smoothbox" rel="gallery" title="Life on the edge"><img src="images/Thumbnails/imgp0842.jpg" alt="Life on the edge" /><i>Life on the edge</i></a></p></div>
<p>
Time for one more attraction on this day - the hike up to Arethusa Falls, the highest waterfall in New Hampshire. 
This was a few miles through more colourful woodland on a well-managed trail. At the waterfall chipmunks and 
squirrels jumped around at a speed too fast to photograph well, but the waterfall presented itself for consideration.
</p>

<p>
After some Chinese food in Lincoln we drove back to the Warren Village Inn and bed.
</p>
<p>We awoke on Monday and found ourselves as the only remaining guests for breakfast. Our landlady 
told us about the history of the house, and all the care and expense she had put into restoring it to its 
immaculate condition. Carpenters had made custom window surrounds, the original fireplace was bought back from 
someone who took it when the house was in a near-derelict state, and the lower bedroom was converted for
wheelchair access. We packed the car and left, stopping to examine the 
<a href="http://www.roadsideamerica.com/tips/getAttraction.php?tip_AttractionNo==863">town missile</a>
and feed the salmon and trout at the fish hatchery. Warren is a pretty little village, and if you are
staying in New Hampshire consider the Village Inn there rather than somewhere in slightly tacky Lincoln,
with its dancing bears.
</p>
<p>
We now had to drive back to Manchester Airport, but we took in some sights on the way. 
<a href="http://www.quincybog.org/">Quincy Bog</a> is a compact little nature reserve focussed on a pond that
is home to beavers and geese.
</p>

<p>
The resident beavers had clearly been living up to their reputation for business, building two dams and a lodge in the
middle of the pool. Gnawed tree stumps were scattered everywhere. However one beaver had clearly bitten off
more than it could drag, with a huge tree lying fallen and abandoned. I checked under the trunk to make
sure it hadn't collapsed onto the poor creature. Maybe it was going to come back tomorrow with a gang of

Our next stop on the way back to Manchester was at <a href="http://www.nhnature.org/">Squam Lake Science Center</a>. Here they keep
mostly injured animals that can't be re-released. There are mammals and birds, some gardens and a gift shop. Interactive exhibits
give children something to play on.  As we left the area, Rebecca had one last moment of excitement...

<p>Then it was back to the airport, turn the car in, get the coach back to Boston, and then the bus and trolley back to her place.
Now I had a couple of days to explore <a href="boston.html">Boston</a>.
