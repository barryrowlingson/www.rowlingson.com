<h1>Day 4 - Avebury to Chippenham (20 miles) or Didcot (40 miles)</h1>
<p>
After a good nights sleep we woke for our continental breakfast - Caroline
hunkered after more farm-grown bacon but it was not to be. We paid up and packed up ready
to get going. The road took us south back towards Avebury together but my way soon led west. Caroline
carried on down the road and out of sight.
</p>
<p>
A hundred yards down a farm track was a ford - I splashed through it and up the steep
bank on the other side. The way continued between hedges until I reached open ground and
the neolithic site of Windmill Hill. Its another ditch and bank enclosure with several round
barrows. I had the place to myself.
</p>

<p>
The steep bank on the other side of Windmill Hill was one reason why it
made a good defensive position - it also gave me a scary descent on the turf. The lane
from the bottom of the hill was deeply rutted, and I nearly came off twice from clipping
my pedals when in a rut. Riding between the ruts was not worth the risk of falling into one. Eventually it
smoothed out and I saw the culprits - two Land Rovers.
</p>
<p>
I was now on National Cycle Route 4, following the obvious signs. There were other less
obvious signs too.
</p>
<a href="images/imgp4425.jpg" class="thickbox" title="strange sign" ><img  src="thumbnails/imgp4425.jpg"  title="strange sign" ></a>
<p>
The church at Cherhill provided me with a little rest and reflection.

<a href="images/imgp4430.jpg" class="thickbox" title="cherhill church graveyard" ><img  src="thumbnails/imgp4430.jpg"  title="cherhill church graveyard" ></a>
<p>
Pressing on, I reached Calne. This seemed like a big city. Its really just a large village, but I'd
been cycling for three days and this was the biggest population centre I'd been in since Oxford.
</p>
<p>
National Cycle Route 4 follows an old disused railway line. Hence there are no steep gradients.
There are still signs of its railway heritage.
</p>

<p>
An old railway bridge crossing the road has been replaced by this elegant arched suspension bridge. It 
swings nicely when you rock it, and the lack of supports underneath make it seem an airy perch above
the traffic.
</p>
<a href="images/imgp4436.jpg" class="thickbox" title="bridge" ><img  src="thumbnails/imgp4436.jpg"  title="bridge" ></a>
<a href="images/imgp4437.jpg" class="thickbox" title="bridge" ><img  src="thumbnails/imgp4437.jpg"  title="bridge" ></a>
<a href="images/imgp4438.jpg" class="thickbox" title="bridge" ><img  src="thumbnails/imgp4438.jpg"  title="bridge" ></a>
<p>
It wasn't far to my sister's in Chippenham now, but I found a well-made bench to sit for a snack amongst the 
butterflies and bugs.
</p>
<a href="images/imgp4440.jpg" class="thickbox" title="elevenses here" ><img  src="thumbnails/imgp4440.jpg"  title="elevenses here" ></a>
<p>
Three miles to Chippenham, my sister's house, and a hot shower! The end of the road for me!
</p>

<a href="images/imgp4450.jpg" class="thickbox" title="teazles" ><img  src="thumbnails/imgp4450.jpg"  title="teazles" ></a>

<p>Meanwhile, Caroline was doing 40 miles back to Didcot along the roads. She passed the Devil's Punchbowl and 
the Uffington White Horse, and pushed on through the pain for the last five miles to get home.
</p>

<p>
The next day my Dad gave me a lift to Oxford station with my bike in
the back and I got the train back to Lancaster. A quiet journey until 
the arrival of 200 scottish football fans on the carriage at Preston 
station. I was home twenty minutes later, leaving a fight between
two opposing scottish teams on the platform at Lancaster station. It was
good to get home.
